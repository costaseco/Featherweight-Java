An attempt to implement the typing rules of Featherweight Java as specified in

[1] Igarashi, Pierce, Wadler. Featherweight Java: A Minimal Core Calculus for Java and GJ. ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 2001.
    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/fj-toplas.pdf

Usage (requires GHC): runhaskell Main.hs <Featherweight Java file>

Known problems:
- m(e*) is seen as a valid expression.
- Circular class declarations will result in an infinite loop instead of an error.
